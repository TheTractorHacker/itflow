# ITFlow API v1 Reference

## What this is

ITFlow ships a REST API used by the ITFlow MSP mobile app, ITPanel Pro, RMM automation scripts, and any custom tooling you want to build against your ITFlow instance. It's the same API surface the built-in mobile app runs on — nothing about it is a stripped-down or read-only subset held back from external integrations.

**Base path:** all endpoints below are relative to `/api/v1` on your ITFlow install, e.g. `https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/tickets`.

**Versioning:** the API is currently unversioned beyond the `/v1` path segment (spec version `1.0.0` in `info.version`). There is no `v2` today; breaking changes would arrive under a new path prefix rather than silently changing `/v1` behavior.

**Machine-readable spec:** the full OpenAPI 3.0 document is served live from the running instance at `GET /api/v1/openapi.yaml`. Import it into Swagger UI, Postman, or Insomnia to browse and try every endpoint interactively, including full request/response JSON Schemas that this document intentionally does not restate in full (see [Where to find full schemas](#where-to-find-full-schemas)).

**Human-readable browsing:** the same spec is also rendered as a searchable, dark-console-styled HTML reference at `GET /api/v1/docs` (also linked from **Settings → API Docs** in the admin panel). It's generated live from `openapi.yaml`, so it's always in sync with what the server actually does.

This document is a narrative companion to those two — read this first to understand the shape of the API and how auth/pagination/errors work, then use `/openapi` or `/docs` for the exact fields on any one endpoint.

---

## Authentication

Every endpoint except the handful marked **public** below requires one of two credentials, sent on every request:

### 1. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — user tokens (recommended for new integrations)

A per-user token issued by `POST /api/v1/auth` (password or passkey login — see [Auth](#auth)). This is the primary mechanism for anything acting as a specific technician or contact: the mobile app, a personal automation script, anything where "who did this" matters. Tokens are revoked with `DELETE /api/v1/auth` (logout).

Use bearer tokens when you need:
- Actions attributed to a specific user (ticket replies, time entries, worksheet signatures)
- Access to `/me` or `/credentials` (both explicitly deny legacy API keys — see below)
- Push token / biometric key registration (mobile app)

### 2. `X-Api-Key: <key>` — legacy instance API keys

A long-lived, instance-wide key managed under **Settings → API Keys** in the admin panel. It resolves internally to the instance's first active admin user rather than to a specific person, which is why it's blocked from `/credentials` (decrypted secrets) and `/me` (a per-user profile) — there's no real "current user" to answer either request as.

Legacy keys are a good fit for server-to-server integrations and scripts that aren't acting as any one technician: RMM webhook receivers, backup-report ingestion, nightly export jobs, that kind of thing.

Two scoping options apply to a legacy key, both set when creating/editing it under Settings → API Keys:

- **Client scope** — a key can be locked to a single client, in which case every client-scoped resource (tickets, assets, credentials list, contracts, etc.) is filtered to that client and cross-client requests are rejected.
- **Permission (read / write)** — new in this release. A key's **Permission** field is either `write` (the default — full access, same as before) or `read`. A `read` key may only issue `GET` requests; any `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` with a read-only key is rejected with `403 {"error": "This API key is read-only"}` before it reaches the resource handler. Use a read-only key for anything that only needs to pull data (dashboards, reporting pulls, read-only RMM lookups) so a leaked key can't be used to modify data.

### Public endpoints (no credential required)

A small set of endpoints are intentionally reachable with no `Authorization` header and no `X-Api-Key` at all:

| Endpoint | Why |
|---|---|
| `POST /auth`, `GET /auth` | You don't have a token yet — this is how you get one. |
| `POST /crash-reports` | Semi-public: honors a bearer token when present (for correlation) but never requires one, because the crash worth capturing most is often the one that happens *before* login succeeds or while a token has just expired. |
| `GET /csat` | Fully public aggregate rating summary, meant to be embedded on a public marketing site (see [Public](#public)). |
| `GET /openapi`, `GET /docs` | The spec and its rendered reference need to be readable before you have credentials to explore anything else. |

### Biometric step-up (credential secrets only)

Decrypted credential secrets (`GET /credentials/{id}`) require more than a bearer token: a signed biometric challenge, on top of normal auth. The flow is:

1. Call `GET /auth` to obtain a challenge (`PasskeyBeginResponse`, including a `challengeToken`).
2. Sign the challenge locally with the device's registered biometric key (registered previously via `PUT /me` with `device_public_key_pem`).
3. Send the request with two extra headers: `X-Biometric-Challenge-Token: <challengeToken>` and `X-Biometric-Signature: <base64 signature>`.

This is the same challenge mechanism used for passkey login completion — `GET /auth` is the one place a challenge originates from, whether you're about to complete a passkey login or about to prove device possession to unseal a credential.

---

## Conventions

These hold across (almost) every endpoint; exceptions are called out per-endpoint in the tables below.

**Lists** return a JSON object:

```json
{ "data": [ ... ], "total": 137 }
```

Some paged endpoints also echo back `page` and `limit`. A handful of list endpoints intentionally return a **bare JSON array** instead of this envelope — usually small, unpaged reference lists (statuses, categories, asset types, worksheet templates) or nested "everything for this one client/ticket" lists. Each one is marked **bare array** in the tables below.

**Creates** return the new row's id:

```json
{ "id": 4821 }
```
sometimes with a few extra fields alongside it (e.g. ticket creation also returns `number` and any `attachments` uploaded with it).

**Simple mutations** (status changes, marking things read, signing, acknowledging alerts) return:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

**Errors** are always a JSON object with an `error` string, paired with the matching HTTP status code:

```json
{ "error": "Ticket not found" }
```

Common status codes you'll see: `400` (bad request — missing/invalid fields), `401` (missing or invalid credential), `403` (authenticated but not permitted — wrong client scope, read-only key doing a write, missing biometric step-up), `404` (not found), `429` (rate limited).

**Pagination** — where supported, `page` (default `1`) and `limit` (default `20`) query parameters control paging; combine with `total` in the response to compute page count. Most list endpoints also accept a `search` query parameter for a simple text filter, and many accept resource-specific filters (`client_id`, `status`, `priority`, etc. — see each endpoint's table row and the OpenAPI spec for the exact parameter set).

**Rate limiting** — 300 requests per 60 seconds per caller (per token or per API key; unauthenticated callers are limited by IP). Exceeding it returns `429` with a `Retry-After` header telling you how many seconds to wait. `POST /crash-reports` has its own tighter limit (20 requests / 5 minutes per IP) since it's reachable without auth.

**Content types** — most endpoints take `application/json`. A few accept file uploads and support **either** `application/json` or `multipart/form-data` on the same route (ticket creation, ticket replies); a few are multipart-only (attachments, expense receipts). These are noted per-endpoint below.

**Streaming** — two endpoints (`GET /tickets/{id}/chat?stream=1` and `GET /notifications/stream`) return `text/event-stream` (Server-Sent Events) instead of a single JSON response. Treat these as long-lived connections (`EventSource` in a browser, or an HTTP client that doesn't buffer/timeout the response) rather than a normal request/response call.

### Where to find full schemas

To keep this document maintainable and accurate, it does not attempt to reproduce full request/response JSON Schemas for all 91 endpoints. For the exact shape of any request body or response — field names, types, which fields are required, enum values — use:

- `GET /api/v1/openapi.yaml` — the canonical OpenAPI 3.0 document, importable into Swagger UI / Postman / Insomnia for interactive "try it" requests against your own instance.
- `GET /api/v1/docs` (or **Settings → API Docs** in the admin panel) — the same spec rendered as a searchable human-readable page.

## Quick start

A minimal end-to-end flow: log in, list open tickets, create one, reply to it.

**1. Log in with a username/password**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "username": "jdoe",
        "password": "correct horse battery staple",
        "device_name": "jdoe-macbook"
      }'
```

Response is either a token:

```json
{ "token": "eyJ...", "user": { "id": 7, "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jdoe@example.com", "type": 3 } }
```

or, if the account has 2FA enabled:

```json
{ "requires_2fa": true }
```

— in which case re-POST the same request with a `totp_code` field added.

Save the token and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every subsequent request. (Passkey/WebAuthn login instead begins with `GET /auth` for a challenge, then `POST /auth` with `passkey_response` + `challenge_token`.)

**2. List your open tickets**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/tickets?status=open&mine=1&limit=20"
```

**3. Create a ticket**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/tickets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "subject": "Printer offline",
        "details": "Front desk printer is not responding to print jobs.",
        "client_id": 42,
        "priority": "medium"
      }'
```

```json
{ "id": 1183, "number": 1183, "attachments": [] }
```

**4. Reply to the ticket (and log time in the same call)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/tickets/1183/reply \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "reply": "Power-cycled the printer and cleared a paper jam. Confirmed working.",
        "type": "reply",
        "time_worked": "00:15:00"
      }'
```

**Using a legacy instance key instead of a bearer token** — swap the `Authorization` header for `X-Api-Key`:

```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $ITFLOW_API_KEY" \
  "https://your-instance.example.com/api/v1/clients"
```

## Endpoint reference

91 endpoints across 24 resource groups. Method color/verb meaning follows normal REST convention: `GET` read, `POST` create/action, `PUT` update, `DELETE` remove.

### Auth

Login (password or passkey), passkey challenge issuance, and logout. Public except logout.

| GET | `/auth` | Begin a WebAuthn/passkey assertion — returns a challenge (also reused for the credential biometric step-up flow). Public. |
| DELETE | `/auth` | Logout — revokes the current bearer token. |

### Dashboard

The agent home-screen summary: open-ticket counters and the caller's personal ticket queue.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/dashboard` | Agent dashboard counters and personal ticket queue. |

Optional `month` (1-12) / `year` query params, default current month. When no active contract configures an allowance, `included`/`remaining`/`pct` come back `null` — treat that as "feature inactive," not zero. |

### Profile

The calling user's own profile — also doubles as the endpoint for registering a mobile push token or a biometric public key. Both deny legacy `X-Api-Key` auth.

| Method | Path | Description |

|---|---|---|
| POST | `/crash-reports` | Report a mobile app crash (logged to App Logs under category `mobile_crash`). Requires `stack_trace`. Public — a bearer token is honored for correlation when present but never required, since the crash worth capturing is often the one that happens before/around a failed login. Its own tighter rate limit applies: 20 requests / 5 minutes per IP. |

### Public

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/csat` | Aggregate CSAT rating summary for public embedding (e.g. a website trust badge). Fully public — no credential accepted or required.

## Notes for common integration scenarios

- **Mobile app / anything acting as a specific technician:** use bearer tokens from `POST /auth`. Register a push token and (optionally) a biometric public key via `PUT /me` once logged in, so you can support push notifications and the biometric step-up flow for credential secrets.
- **RMM scripts / server-to-server jobs with no specific user:** use a legacy `X-Api-Key`. Scope it to a single client if the integration only ever needs one client's data, and set its Permission to `read` unless the integration genuinely needs to create/update records — a leaked read-only key is a much smaller incident.
- **Public-facing widgets (e.g. a "customer satisfaction" badge on a marketing site):** `GET /csat` needs no credential at all and is safe to call directly from client-side JavaScript.
- **Polling vs. streaming:** ticket chat and notifications both support either a plain polling `GET` (with `since_id` on chat for incremental fetches) or an SSE stream (`?stream=1` on chat, `/notifications/stream` for notifications) — pick streaming for a live UI, polling for anything simpler or running somewhere SSE is awkward (e.g. some serverless environments).
